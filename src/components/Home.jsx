        <h1 className="heading">What is Dota 2?</h1>
        <p className="p1">Dota 2 is an online multiplayer game where you and four teammates choose from a roster of different heroes and, over the course of each match, gradually grow in strength and power until you're strong enough to take down the enemy team's Ancient - the glowing building in their home base.</p>
        <p className="p2">Of course, the opposing team has their eye on your Ancient, too, and wants to smash it to smithereens. So the whole match is a strategic balancing act, as you decide what you need to do to gain advantage for your team, while also making sure the enemy doesn't snowball out of control.</p>
        <p className="p3">Many millions of hours of brainpower have gone into figuring out the optimal ways to do this, so there's plenty to study - but, crucially, none of your teammates or enemies know how to play optimally, so really, it's all about punishing your enemies' mistakes while trying not to make too many of your own.</p>
